<h1>The A - R of Technology Terms</h1>
<body>
    <dl>
        <dt>ADSL</dt>
        <dd>Asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL) is a type of digital subscriber line (DSL) 
            broadband technology that is used to connect to the Internet. It uses standard telephone 
            lines to deliver high-speed data communications (up to 24 megabytes per second).</dd>
        <dt>Bluetooth</dt>
        <dd>Bluetooth is a wireless communications technology intended to replace cables. It allows 
             short-range connections between two or more Bluetooth-compatible devices such as mobile 
             phones, tablets, headsets or medical equipment.</dd>
        <dt>Boot (re-boot)</dt>
        <dd>To boot (or re-boot) is to load and initialise the operating system on a computer. 
            Think of it as starting up your computer. In Windows you can use the key combination CTRL 
             and ALT and DEL as a "soft" boot. This means restarting the computer rather than turning  
             it completely off and on again, which could cause damage to your computer's hard disk under 
              some circumstances.</dd>
        <dt>Broadband</dt>
        <dd>Broadband is a type of communications technology whereby a single wire can carry more than one 
             type of signal at once; for example, audio and video. Cable TV is one technology that uses 
             broadband data transmission.</dd>
        <dt>Cache</dt>
        <dd>When you download (read) a web page, the data is "cached," meaning it is temporarily stored on your computer. 
             The next time you want that page, instead of requesting the file from the web server, your web browser 
             just accesses it from the cache, so the page loads quickly. The downside to this is that if the cached 
             web page is often updated, you may miss the latest version. If you suspect that the web page you're seeing 
             is not the latest version, use the "refresh" button on your browser.</dd>
        <dt>CPU</dt>
        <dd>The central processing unit (CPU) is the brains behind your computer. The CPU is responsible for performing 
             calculations and tasks that make programs work. The higher the speed of a CPU, the faster the CPU undertakes 
             the calculations and tasks.</dd>
        <dt>Cybercrime</dt>
        <dd>Cybercrime is any type of illegal activity that is undertaken (or relies heavily) on a computer. 
            There are thousands of types of cybercrime, including network intrusions, identity theft and the spreading of computer viruses.</dd>
        <dt>Cybersecurity</dt>
        <dd>Cybersecurity refers to measures designed to protect your computer, device or network from cybercrime. This involves preventing unintended  
            and unauthorised access, change and damage.</dd>
        <dt>Download</dt>
        <dd>Downloading is the method by which users access and save or "pull down" software or other files to their own computers from a remote computer via the Internet.</dd>
        <dt>Firewall</dt>
        <dd>A firewall is a barrier that acts as a security system to protect trusted computer systems and networks from outside connections and untrusted networks,  such as the Internet.</dd>
        <dt>Gateway</dt>
        <dd>A point within a network that interconnects with other networks.</dd>
        <dt>GIF</dt>
        <dd>Graphics interchange format (GIF) is a graphics file format. Because GIF files are compressed, they can be quickly and easily transmitted over a network.  GIF is one of the main graphics formats on the Internet.</dd>
        <dt>HTML</dt>
        <dd>Hyper-text markup language (HTML) is a set of symbols inserted into files intended for display on the world wide web. The symbols tell web browsers  
            how to display words and images - e.g. which colour, font and type size to use - and they direct it to link to other pages on the world wide web via hyperlinks.</dd>
        <dt>Internet</dt>
        <dd>A set of interconnected networks that allow computers in different locations 
             to exchange information. The Internet includes services such as the world wide web, 
             electronic mail, file transfer protocol (FTP), chat and remote access to networks and computers.</dd>
        <dt>ISP</dt>
        <dd>An internet service provider (ISP) is a company that provides access to the Internet. 
            In Australia, widely used ISPs include Bigpond, iinet and Dodo.</dd>
        <dt>JPEG</dt>
        <dd>JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group, which was the committee that created 
             the file format known as JPEG. The format is commonlyl used for photos displayed on the 
              world wide web.</dd>
        <dt>LAN</dt>
        <dd>A local area network (LAN) is a system that connects computers and other devices that  
            share a common communications line and wireless link, generally within a limited geographical 
             area such as a home or office building.</dd>
        <dt>Modem</dt>
        <dd>A modem is a device that allows computers to transmit information to each other via ordinary telephone lines.</dd>
        <dt>Operating system</dt>
        <dd>An operating system (OS) is the software that manages all of a computer's processes and allows programs  
            and applications to run. The most prominent operating system is Microsoft Windows. Others include Mac OS X and Linux.</dd>
        <dt>RAM</dt>
        <dd>Random access memory (RAM) is usually referred to as a computer's "memory" - it stores information used by programs. Generally, the larger your computer's RAM, the more programs it can run at once without slowing down.</dd>
